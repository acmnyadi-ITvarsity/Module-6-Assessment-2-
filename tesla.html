        <h1>Tesla Model X</h1>

    <p>The Model X is the safest, fastest and most capable sport-utility vehicle in history. At least that’s what Tesla says. Hyperbole aside, the mid-sized, electric luxury vehicle comes with a 100-kWh battery, providing a maximum reported 475 kilometres of range. A dual-motor setup digitally and independently control torque to the front and rear wheels, giving the SUV all-wheel drive. Two models are offered and both are fast: the 100D accelerates from zero to 100 km/h in 4.9 seconds; the P100D does it in 3.1 seconds.  Model X will seat from five to seven, depending on the seating arrangement selected. Its most notable feature is its gull-wing doors — “falcon wing” in Tesla parlance — that articulate up and out of the way. The Model X’s list of standard active safety features and hardware include eight surround cameras that allow for 360-degree vision, while 12 ultrasonic sensors provide detection of surrounding objects. Forward-facing radar supposedly sees through heavy rain, fog, dust, and beyond the vehicle ahead — helping to prevent accidents by providing simultaneous visibility in every direction.</p>
