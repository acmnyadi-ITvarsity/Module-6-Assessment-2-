    <h1>Audi E-Tron</h1>
    <img src="images/e-tron.jpg">
    <p>Audi’s first production electric vehicle, the e-tron, was joined for 2020 by the more stylish e-tron Sportback. Both are mid-sized crossovers powered by two asynchronous electric motors — one driving each axle — and a 95-kWh lithium-ion battery, the combination delivering a driving range of some 400 kilometres, according to the company. The two electric motors deliver 355 hp and 414 lb-ft of torque. There is also a Sport mode that cranks the output up to 402 hp and 490 lb-ft of torque for eight seconds. Power reaches the wheels through a single-speed transmission at each motor. With Audi drive select, the driver can vary the characteristics of the e-tron between seven profiles depending on the driving situation, road conditions or personal preferences. The system also alters the standard air suspension, providing ride settings ranging from comfort to sport. Both vehicles come with two years of unlimited 30-minute DC fast charging sessions (with one-hour intervals between charges) on the Electrify Canada HPC Charging Network.</p>
