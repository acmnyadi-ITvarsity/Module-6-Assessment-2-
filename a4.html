    <h1>Audi A4 Allroad</h1>
    <img src="images/a4.png">
<p>The 2020 model year saw the same mild refresh of the wagon-bodied A4 Allroad as the sedan. And, like the sedan, the 2021 Allroad gets a 13-hp power bump (new 261 hp) to its turbocharged 2.0L four-cylinder as well as a 12-volt mild-hybrid electric system. Said engine is hooked up to a seven-speed S Tronic automatic transmission sending power through the Quattro all-wheel-drive setup. Last yearâ€™s mods to the Allroad were subtle, the quasi-crossover getting the same new grille as on the sedan, while still retaining its flared wheel arches, underbody guard, rear diffuser and raised roof rails. The standard adaptive damping suspension provides an increased ground clearance of 34 mm over the A4 sedan, achieved through a taller suspension and higher profile tires, making the Allroad a more capable choice for off paved road terrain. The Allroad continues to be offered in Komfort, Progressiv and Technik trims.</p>
