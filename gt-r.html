    <img src="images/gt-r.jpg">
    <p>The Nissan GT-R is a high performance sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan that was unveiled in 2007.
        It is the successor to the Skyline. Although this car was the sixth generation model to bear the GT-R name, the model is no longer part of the Nissan Skyline model lineup since that name is now reserved for Nissan's Luxury sport vehicles.
        The GT-R shares the Nissan FM platform with the separate Nissan Skyline luxury car and the Nissan Z sports car.
