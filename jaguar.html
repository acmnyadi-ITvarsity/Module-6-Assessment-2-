    <h1>Jaguar XE </h1>
    <img src="images/jaguar.png">
    <p>Jaguar revisited the compact sport sedan segment in 2017 with the all-wheel-drive XE. The aluminum-intensive XE offers lightweight construction, streamlined styling, an upscale interior and sporting ride and handling. It was also the first model developed from the JLR modular vehicle architecture. The XE S gets its power from a supercharged 3.0-litre V6 generating 380 horsepower. The engine is linked to an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shift controls. There is also the 25t and 30t, both powered by turbocharged 2.0L four-cylinders putting out 247 and 296 hp respectively. The fuel economy leader is the XE 20d, powered by the company's Ingenium 2.0L turbodiesel four-cylinder delivering 180 hp and 318 lb-ft of torque and also mated with the eight-speed automatic transmission. The compact sport sedan is being refreshed for the 2020 model year.</p>
