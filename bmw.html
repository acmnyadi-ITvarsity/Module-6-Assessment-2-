    <img src="images/bmw.png">
<p>The latest additions to the 3 Series model lineup are the plug-in-hybrid 330e and 330e xDrive sedans, delivering “exhilarating driving experiences while lowering emissions and allowing for purely electric driving,” says BMW. The 2.0L turbocharged four develops 184 hp, with an electric motor kicking in another 113 hp. Combined output is 288 hp and torque is 310 lb-ft. The 330e is rear-wheel drive; all other models, hybrid and ICE, are AWD. The regular sedan models are represented by 330i xDrive and M340i xDrive. The seventh-generation 3 Series was new for the 2019 model year, boasting numerous upgrades, and the 2.0L four-cylinder powering the 330i xDrive delivers 255 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. Complementing the engine is a standard eight-speed Steptronic transmission. The M340i xDrive features a turbocharged 3.0L six-cylinder, M Performance chassis tuning and an M Sport rear differential. The engine produces 382 hp and 368 lb-ft of torque, taking the four-door into territory previously inhabited by M cars. Its eight-speed Sport Steptronic transmission comes with a Launch Control function to optimize traction during acceleration off the line. Shift paddles on the steering wheel allow for manual gear selection.</p>
