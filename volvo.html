    <img src="images/volvo.png">
    <p>Volvo’s entry-level S60 sedan, redesigned for the 2019 model year and built in the United States, is being offered in four trims with two available 2.0-litre four-cylinder engines as well as a plug-in hybrid variant. First off is the Momentum, available as the front-wheel-drive T5 and the all-wheel drive T6. The T5’s turbo 2.0L puts out 250 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. T6 versions add a supercharger to the turbo engine, boosting horsepower to 316 and torque to 295 lb-ft. The sportier R-Design is available in T5 AWD and T6 AWD and hybrid T8 eAWD versions, the latter adding an 87-hp electric motor to the super/turbo 2.0L for a net system output of 400 hp and 472 lb-ft of torque. The luxurious Inscription also comes in T5 AWD and T6 AWD form. At the top end is the Polestar Engineered T8 eAWD, a performance sedan with a powerful plug-in hybrid powertrain. In addition to the hybrid setup being bumped up to 415 net hp, upgraded suspension and braking components are added. All Volvos are fitted with Volvo’s Sensus connectivity and infotainment system, which delivers a touchscreen interface that combines car functions, navigation, connected services and in-car entertainment applications.</p>
