    <h1>Mercedes Benz C-Class</h1>
    <img src="images/c-class.png">
    <p>Mercedes’ top-selling model has some upgrades for 2021, notably a new Avantgarde Edition for both the regular and AMG models. The C 300 4Matic sedan, coupe, wagon and convertible are powered by a 255 hp, 2.0L turbo four, while the C 43 4Matic variants have a sportier 385 hp, 3.0L twin-turbo V6. The high-performance Mercedes-AMG 63 models — the C 63 and C 63 S — get a Speedshift nine-speed MCT as standard, along with an AMG Dynamics system and AMG traction control system. Both are powered by a twin-turbo 4.0L V8, the 63 engine puts out 479 hp while the 63 S ups the pony count to 503 hp. A new 2022 model will arrive early next year, bringing in “a range of high-tech features derived from the flagship S-Class.” Mercedes further notes that the sedan will set “a new standard in efficiency with a systemic electrification of the modern four-cylinder engine.” This includes an integrated starter-generator that uses a 48-volt onboard electrical system to allow gliding, boosting and energy recovery.</p>
