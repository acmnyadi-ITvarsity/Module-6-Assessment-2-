    <h1>Lexus IS</h1>
    <img src="images/lexus.png">
    <p>Lexus has given the IS sport sedan a stylish refresh for 2021, the makeover including slimmer headlights, revised grille, larger fender flares and a new trunk lid with a wider spoiler. Inside, the interior features standard NuLuxe-trimmed seats, a dual-zone automatic climate control system with touch-sensitive controls and Smart Key with push-button start. New for 2021, the touchscreen has been repositioned to closer to the driver for easier access to the controls, while a new 10.3-inch touchscreen is available. The new multimedia system features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The 2021 IS is available in both rear-wheel drive and all-wheel-drive versions, and there are three distinct powertrain options available depending upon the trim. The IS 300 RWD F Sport Series 1 is the base model and features a turbo 2.0L four-cylinder mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The IS 300 AWD is powered by a 3.5L V6 that delivers 260 hp to all four wheels through a six-speed automatic. Those craving maximum power can move up to the IS 350 AWD F Sport Series, powered by a more muscular 3.5L V6 that produces 311 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque, coupled with a six-speed automatic transmission.</p>
